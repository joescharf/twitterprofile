## Twitter Oauth

We have to use Twitter Oauth1 for now because it provides the read/write endpoints for the User Profile. Twitter hasn't ported the write capability to their APIv2 Yet.

I did go down the road of implementing Twitter Oauth2 in this library. Currently it's unused but the auth code is in auth_twitter.go. Requires TP_CLIENT_ID / TP_CLIENT_SECRET env vars in the .env file.

- [twitter-oauth1](https://github.com/dghubble/gologin#twitter-oauth1) Is a nice library that handles all the twitter Oauth1 including login and callback endpoints.
